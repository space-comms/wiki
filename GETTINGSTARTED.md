# Getting Started

Your first step into amateur radio is to gain your [Foundation License](https://rsgb.org/main/clubs-training/for-students/foundation/)
which is issued by Ofcom. To gain your license, you will need to study for, and pass, the Foundation exam.

This is a one-hour multiple choice exam which you take online. The exam helps to ensure that you can operate safely and without
causing issues to other radio users.

## The exam

The Foundation exam is taken online and you will be informed of your result immediately. When you're ready you can  [book and pay for your exam](https://rsgb.org/main/clubs-training/for-students/paying-for-your-exam/) through the RSGB website, and take
your exam online at a time/date that suits you.

Once you have passed your exam and have received official confirmation of your result, you can register on the [Ofcom licensing system](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/spectrum/radio-equipment/licensing-portals), choose your callsign and apply for your licence.
