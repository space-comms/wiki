# Radio Systems Research

We explore the design, simulation, and testing of radio systems for space and terrestrial applications. Topics include:

- Antenna design and optimization
- RF propagation and link budgets
- Software-defined radio (SDR)
- Amateur radio in space (AMSAT)
- Interference mitigation

We welcome collaboration with amateur radio operators and RF engineers.
