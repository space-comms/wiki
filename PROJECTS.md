# Projects

Leeds Space Comms runs several projects. Explore our work and get involved!

## Weekly Club Nets
- Every week we run club nets.
- A net is a scheduled gathering of amateur radio operators on a specific frequency. There's a net control station that manages the conversation - they call for check-ins, keep track of who's participating, and coordinate who talks when. Think of it like an organized conference call over the radio. We typically check in with our call signs, then the net control runs through participants for comments, questions, or announcements. It's great practice for proper radio procedures.

## FT8 decoder
- FT8 is a digital mode for amateur radio developed by Joe Taylor, K1JT, and others as part of the WJST-X project.
- PhD student, Miguel Boing, and Professor Leandro Soares Indrusiak, are searching for talented students to work on making a receiver for decoding their radio signals.
- Their project involves training a neural network to  find correlations for radio signals to determine how well the bands are doing. They have an antenna on the roof of the Chemistry Building where they make 144 transmissions every day every 15 minutes.
- This project will provide you experience working with digital communications.
- Involves Python Programming and Digital Signal Processing

## Antenna Building Workshops
- To build experience with antenna building, we are running workshops in G.68 to build Yagi Antennas.
- This will teach participants how to concepts of impedance matching, SWR, using a VNA, radiation patterns, and dipoles.
- All participants must undertake a H&S tutorial prior.

## UHF Omnidirectional Satellite Ground Station
- We want to set up an omnidirectional satellite ground station to send data to the SatNOGS network.
- We need to make a grant to get the equipment to guy the 12 m pole, and the UHF antenna which will receive the UHF satellite signals.

## UHF Directional Satellite Ground Station
- We have made a mechanically steered antenna rotator that can track low-earth satellites using a directional antenna.

## SOTA Field Trips
- We want to go on field trips to travel to remote locations and set up antennas on mountain peaks where we will endeavour to make DX (long distance) contacts.
- Professor Leandro Soares Indrusiak offered to invite us to these field trips.

## EME Event
- In collaboration with the Otley Amateur Radio Society, we want to bounce signals off the moon to demonstrate EME communications.
- Otley has all the equipment needed to make this happen, they are searching for talented students to determine what they need to do.
- This will build your experience with link budgets, antenna theory, transceivers, and amateur radio software.

## Amateur Radio Direction Finding (Foxhunting)
- We are running a foxhunting event in Hyde Park on the 2nd of November, where we set up hidden transmitters (fox beacons) and participants use radio receivers to locate the beacons. 

## QO-100 Microwave Satellite Ground Station
- We want to create a microwave satellite ground station for decoding the QO-100, a geostationary amateur radio satellite.

## ARISS Contact
- The ultimate goal of Leeds Space Comms, where will make an amateur radio contact with astronauts aboard the International Space  Station.

## ISS APRS Packet Operation

## Amateur Radio Shack at the University
- To establish our group long-term at the University of Leeds, we want our own amateur radio shack.
