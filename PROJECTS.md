# Projects

Leeds Space Comms runs several projects. Explore our work and get involved!

## Weekly Nets
- regular club nets where we all get together and go on the radio on a specified frequency and time. 
- a net is a scheduled gathering of amateur radio operators on a specific frequency. There's a net control station that manages the conversation - they call for check-ins, keep track of who's participating, and coordinate who talks when. Think of it like an organized conference call over the radio. We typically check in with our call signs, then the net control runs through participants for comments, questions, or announcements. It's great practice for proper radio procedures.

## WJST-X Decoder
