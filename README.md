# LUCIA (Leeds Urban Climate Investigation Apparatus): Leeds CubeSat Project

Welcome to the official repository for the Leeds Urban and Climate Investigation Apparatus ("LUCIA") project, developed by the Leeds Space // Comms Group at Leeds University. This open-source initiative aims to design, build, and launch a functional CubeSat, while providing a comprehensive educational resource on CubeSats and the complete satellite development process.

## Project Vision

**LUCIA (Leeds Urban Climate Investigation Apparatus)** is an academic satellite mission intended to pioneer accessible space engineering at Leeds University. Our mission is not only to develop and launch a satellite, but to document every step, decision, and lesson so that future teams and independent learners can follow and build upon our work.

## What is a CubeSat?

A CubeSat is a class of miniaturized satellite with standardized sizes and interfaces, most commonly organized in units of 10 x 10 x 10 cm ("1U"). CubeSats have transformed access to space for educational, research, and commercial purposes due to their modularity, affordability, and use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components.

## The CubeSat Development Process: Overview

Building a CubeSat like LUCIA involves multiple phases and specialized subsystems. Here is a high-level overview:

1. **Mission Concept and Requirements**
   - Define objectives, such as scientific goals or technology demonstrations.
   - Perform feasibility studies and trade-off analyses.

2. **System Architecture**
   - Design the overall structure and interfaces between subsystems.
   - Balance power, mass, volume, and communication needs.

3. **Subsystem Design**
   - **Structure:** Mechanical frame, deployables, shielding.
   - **Power (EPS):** Solar panels, batteries, power management.
   - **On-Board Computer (OBC):** Central processing, data handling.
   - **Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS):** Orientation, sensors, actuators.
   - **Communications (Comms):** Radio systems, antennas, ground link.
   - **Payload:** The scientific or engineering instrument(s).
   - **Thermal:** Insulation, heaters, thermal analysis.

4. **Integration and Testing**
   - Assemble subsystems, perform functional and environmental testing.
   - Verify interfaces and simulate mission scenarios.

5. **Launch and Operations**
   - Final integration with deployer/launch vehicle.
   - Regulatory clearance and coordination.
   - Ground station setup and operations planning.
