# Subsystem Design: Overview

Every CubeSat (including LUCIA) is comprised of key subsystems, each fulfilling a specialized function. Each subsystem is described on a dedicated page:

- [Structure](Structure.md)
- [Electrical Power System (EPS)](EPS.md)
- [On-Board Computer (OBC)](OBC.md)
- [Attitude Determination & Control System (ADCS)](ADCS.md)
- [Communications](Communications.md)
- [Thermal](Thermal.md)
- [Payload](Payload.md)

Each subsystem section discusses:

- Function and requirements
- Hardware and software options
- Design trade-offs
- Testing and integration

If you’re new to satellite engineering, read through all sections to understand how LUCIA’s design decisions are made.
