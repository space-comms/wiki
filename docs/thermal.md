# Thermal Subsystem

## Function

Maintains all CubeSat components within their safe temperature range during all mission phases.

## Methods

- **Passive:** Insulation (MLI), surface coatings (paint, tape), thermal straps
- **Active:** Resistive heaters (if needed), controlled by OBC

## Analysis

- Thermal modeling (software-based) for all mission phases
- Identify hot/cold spots, worst-case scenarios (eclipse, sun-pointing)

## Sensors

- Multiple temperature sensors at key locations

## Testing

- Thermal vacuum (TVAC) cycling to simulate space conditions
