# RF Propagation Studies

## Introduction
Understanding radio frequency (RF) propagation is essential for reliable satellite communications. We conducted field tests and simulations to characterize signal loss and multipath effects on campus.

## Methods
- Path loss measured with SDR and calibrated signal source
- Simulated urban propagation using ITU-R models

## Results
- Significant attenuation observed near tall buildings
- Multipath fading mitigated by antenna diversity
