# Power System Trade-Offs in LUCIA

## Introduction
Power is a major constraint for CubeSats. We compared different solar cell types, battery chemistries, and power management ICs.

## Findings
- **Solar Cells:** AzurSpace 3G30A selected for high efficiency
- **Batteries:** LiFePO4 chosen for safety and cycle life
- **PMIC:** Texas Instruments BQ series

## Lessons Learned
- Deployable panels increase risk but are necessary for >2W average power
- Battery heaters are essential for winter passes
