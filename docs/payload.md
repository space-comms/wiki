# Payload Subsystem

## Function

The payload is the primary instrument or experiment for the mission. For LUCIA, options may include:

- Low-resolution camera for Earth imaging
- Radiation/environmental sensors
- Amateur radio repeater

## Requirements

- Fit within allocated mass, volume, and power
- Interface with OBC for command/data
- Data rate and storage compatible with comms and OBC

## Data Path

- Payload → OBC → Downlink (to ground)
- Onboard data processing/compression as needed

## Testing

- Laboratory simulations of expected performance
- Interface testing with OBC and comms
