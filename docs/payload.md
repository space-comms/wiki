# Payload Subsystem

## Function

The payload is the primary instrument or experiment for the mission. For LUCIA this includes:

- Wide Field Camera, designed for panoramic imaging and broad overviews of Leeds
- Telephoto RGB Camera,, focused on high-resolution imaging capturing visual data with the goal of creating time series of 3D models of the urban landscape by photogrammetry
- Infrared Camere, measuring surface temperatures around the city, deteching potential heat islands and assessing the impact of policy and climate change.
- Image Processing Unit, responsible for capture and real-time processsing of the images. As an extention to traditional processing tasks, such as cropping and compression, we hope to use an ML model to intelligently filter, identify and tag relevant images for transmission, this would greatly optimise bandwidth.




## Requirements



## Data Path

- Payload → OBC → Downlink (to ground)
- Onboard data processing/compression as needed

## Testing

- Laboratory simulations of expected performance
- Interface testing with OBC and comms


# Wide Field Camera

The wide field camera is for capturing the widescreen photos we love so much. It is designed to capture the entirety of Leeds and the West Yorkshire area. T
