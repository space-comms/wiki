# Antenna Design for LUCIA CubeSat

## Overview
Antenna selection and design is critical for reliable CubeSat communications. For LUCIA, we evaluated several antenna types, including monopole, dipole, and patch antennas, considering deployment constraints and link budget requirements.

## Design Process
- **Simulation:** Used CST Studio and openEMS for radiation pattern and gain analysis.
- **Prototyping:** Built 3D-printed and copper tape prototypes for VHF/UHF bands.
- **Testing:** Measured VSWR and return loss using a NanoVNA.

## Results
The final design is a deployable tape-measure dipole, chosen for its simplicity and proven flight heritage ([AMSAT Fox-1](https://www.amsat.org/fox-1-cubesat/)).
