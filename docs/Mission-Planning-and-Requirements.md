# Mission Planning and Requirements

## Step 1: Defining the Mission

- **Mission Statement:** What do you want your CubeSat to achieve? (e.g., test technology, collect science data, enable communication, etc.)
- **Primary & Secondary Objectives:** List all desired outcomes, prioritized.
- **Success Criteria:** Define what constitutes mission success and partial success.

## Step 2: Constraints and Stakeholders

- **Physical Constraints:** Size (e.g., 1U), mass (<1.33 kg per U), power, available volume.
- **Budget:** Hardware, launch, operations, licensing.
- **Timeline:** Key milestones and deadlines.
- **Stakeholders:** University, funding bodies, industry partners, regulatory agencies.

## Step 3: Requirements Flowdown

- **System Requirements:** High-level needs (e.g., must operate in LEO for 6 months).
- **Subsystem Requirements:** Specifics for power, comms, ADCS, etc.
- **Verification Plan:** How will you prove requirements are met? (analysis, test, demonstration)

## Step 4: Risk Management

- **Risk Identification:** Launch failure, subsystem malfunction, regulatory delays, etc.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Redundancy, thorough testing, documentation, backup launch plans.
