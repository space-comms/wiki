# Structure Subsystem

## Function

The structure is the mechanical backbone of the CubeSat. It provides physical support, protection, and mounting for all subsystems, while conforming to launch provider requirements.

## Design Requirements

- **Form Factor:** 1U (10x10x10 cm) for LUCIA
- **Material:** Aerospace-grade aluminum (6061/7075) or composites
- **Mass Budget:** Minimize while maintaining rigidity
- **Launch Loads:** Must withstand vibration, shock, and G-forces
- **Deployment:** Accommodate antennas/solar panels if deployable

## Integration

- All PCBs, batteries, and payload are fixed to rails or brackets.
- Access panels for assembly and testing.
- Surface treatments for thermal control and corrosion resistance.

## Testing

- Fit checks with subsystem boards and payload
- Vibration testing per launch provider specs
- Mass properties measurement
