# CubeSat Fundamentals

## What is a CubeSat?

A CubeSat is a standardized, modular, miniaturized satellite—typically built in multiples of 10x10x10 cm cubes (1U, 2U, 3U, etc.). CubeSats are designed for low-cost access to space and have become a global standard for university and research missions.

## Why CubeSats?

- **Standardization:** Simplifies design, integration, and launch.
- **Cost-effective:** Uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and shared launch opportunities.
- **Rapid Development:** Projects can be completed in 1–3 years.
- **Educational Value:** Hands-on experience for students in aerospace, engineering, and science.

## Key Phases in a CubeSat Project

1. **Mission Planning:** Define goals, technical requirements, constraints, and success criteria.
2. **System Design:** Create architecture, select and design subsystems.
3. **Integration & Testing:** Assemble and verify functionality and environmental robustness.
4. **Launch & Operations:** Prepare for liftoff, deploy, and operate in orbit.

## About LUCIA (Leeds Urban Climate Investigation Apparatus)

LUCIA (Leeds Urban Climate Investigation Apparatus) is Leeds University's first CubeSat mission. This mission embodies innovation, teamwork, and academic excellence, focusing on investigating urban climate patterns from space. LUCIA aims to deliver a practical payload to low Earth orbit and provide an open, step-by-step reference for all who follow.
