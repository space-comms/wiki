# CubeSat Fundamentals

## What is a CubeSat?

A CubeSat is a standardized, modular, miniaturized satellite—typically built in multiples of 10x10x10 cm cubes (1U, 2U, 3U, etc.). CubeSats are designed for low-cost access to space and have become a global standard for university and research missions.

## Why CubeSats?

- **Standardization:** Simplifies design, integration, and launch.
- **Cost-effective:** Uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and shared launch opportunities.
- **Rapid Development:** Projects can be completed in 1–3 years.
- **Educational Value:** Hands-on experience for students in aerospace, engineering, and science.

## Key Phases in a CubeSat Project

1. **Mission Planning:** Define goals, technical requirements, constraints, and success criteria.
2. **System Design:** Create architecture, select and design subsystems.
3. **Integration & Testing:** Assemble and verify functionality and environmental robustness.
4. **Launch & Operations:** Prepare for liftoff, deploy, and operate in orbit.

## About G-Sat (Gryphon Satellite)

G-Sat is the working title for Leeds University's first CubeSat. Named after the gryphon—a symbol of Leeds—the mission embodies innovation, teamwork, and academic excellence. G-Sat aims to deliver a practical payload to low Earth orbit and provide an open, step-by-step reference for all who follow.
