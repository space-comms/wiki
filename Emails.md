## Request for Loaning out FM Broadcasting Equipment
Hi William,

As we discussed on Friday, here is the information that you require

The next step once you get the okay from the University to go ahead with your project is to apply for the licence. Our engineer Nik Fox has kindly said you can drop him an email if you need any help with this process. His email is nik.fox@cotswoldgrp.com 

In terms of the kit we would provide, this is a rough guide (depends on the licence you get given). We can do it for £250 for the week.

TX5 V3 or TX30 V3
Antenna
25/50m Antenna Cable (need to keep cabling as short as possible)
Barix Exstremer 100 (if needed to pull stream off the internet)

From the Student radio you would require an audio feed of the show from the studio. Depending where the transmitter will be installed, this can be done 1 of 2 ways. 

If the transmitter is close to the studio:

Studio -- (over analogue XLR) -- Transmitter -- Antenna 

If the transmitter needs to be further away:

Studio (online live stream)   --------  Internet connection into Barix Exstreamer to download stream (will need stream key or similar) -- (analogue audio) -- Transmitter -- Antenna

Please let me know if you have any questions 

Kind regards

## New Raynet Members
Hi William,
I hope you are well.

Lee has passed me your details and said that you would like to join Leeds RAYNET.

As a group we support a number of public events over the year as well as being available to support emergency response in times of crisis. We work closely with other Raynet groups across Yorkshire. Almost every event is a combined effort between two or more Raynet groups, with one group leading the event depending on where it takes place. Leeds leads on the Leeds Country Way Relay Race held on the first Sunday in September each year and supports dozens of other events across the region.

Operation at most events is on 2m, with use of 70cm to access talk-through units occasionally required. We primarily use our own equipment. A 2m mobile radio and/or hand held are the basic equipment we need to operate. Operators also need a high vis jacket and “Raynet” inserts can be purchased to let everybody know you’re part of the team. If you don’t have an amateur licence, we have PMR radios which can be used for shorter range communication.

To be a member of Leeds Raynet, we ask that you support the group by attending events through the year. The donations we receive from event organisers cover the costs of insurance and membership with the national Raynet UK charity, which provides access to resources and ensures you are fully covered while carrying out Raynet duties.

I have attached a copy of the registration form for you to look over and return back to myself. The registration process would involve meeting either in person or virtually to verify your ID. If you would prefer to go through the form together we can do that.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,

Linda

## EME Event
Hi Sean,

Thanks for coming back with that.

We already use WSJT-X in the shack for FT-8 on the FTDX10.
It should be relatively simple to swap over to the FT-991A, but testing in advance would definitely be worthwhile, and it also might be a good plan to use a different computer, as we've had problems with swapping between radios. I've currently got the shack laptop in bits for a clean, re-paste and "upgrade" to Windows 11.

As far as the date goes, next Tuesday might not be ideal. We've been invited to a POTA talk, beginning slightly earlier than usual, which we'll probably be offering as there's been a lot of interest in portable operation recently if there's some support for it tonight.
It's also forecast for rain next Tuesday, which might not prevent any EME, but will definitely make it more difficult to set everything up and pack it away at the end, especially as it's going to be cold outside.


I'm not going to be at the club until quite late tonight, as I have a meeting before, but you're of course welcome to come along.

Regards,
Richard.

## Potential Collaboration on THz CubeSat Mission
Hi William,

 

As Professor Davies says, it’s quite challenging to launch a THz payload, owing to (a) the strong absorption of THz waves in the lower atmosphere, and (b) the need for cryogenic cooling if you’re using a QCL as a source, or an HEB mixer.  The two mission concepts that we’re currently developing are:

Keystone (formerly LOCUS) - https://www.nrao.edu/meetings/isstt/papers/2015/2015000003.pdf
LETO (formerly FIRSS) - The far-infrared spectroscopic surveyor (FIRSS) | Experimental Astronomy
 

These are both science mission concepts, for radiometric measurements of remote gases… however, they still use a THz local oscillator and mixer, so the concepts could potentially be adapted to communications applications.

 

I’m not sure what the payload capacities on a CubeSat are, but you’d need to think carefully about the power and mass budget.  Both mission concepts above use Stirling-cycle coolers (~20-30 W power consumption and ~2 kg mass) to cool the QCLs.

 

You might also want to look at the OSAS-B mission (CO Meeting Organizer EGU21) for ideas, which uses solid nitrogen to cool a QCL on a balloon mission.  This approach eliminates the need for a cryocooler but limits the total mission time.  Maybe fine for a short-term TRL-raising comms demo though?

 

Hope that’s of some use!

 

AV
