# About Leeds Space Comms

Leeds Space Comms is a special interest amateur radio group at the University of Leeds, dedicated to advancing the sport of amateur radio, space communications, and microwave engineering. We welcome students from all backgrounds and skill levels to join us in building, learning, and exploring together.

Our mission is to bridge the skills gap for students, foster collaboration, and inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists.

# Our Philosophy

- Grow the pie for members, the uni, and the wider space-comms community
- Learn as much as possible, and share what you learn
- Just be useful to the mission and to each other
- Experiment boldy, deliver reliably
